    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Ashwathy, and I’m passionate about creating efficient, secure,
      and scalable systems that power the cloud. My interest in cloud computing
      and automation began during my time as a systems engineer when I automated
      enterprise device requests processes to Service Now— discovering the joy
      of turning complex challenges into streamlined solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to today, I’ve had the privilege of working at banking and 
      huge corporations, contributing by automating Python scripts to validate 
      HDFS data and building CI/CD pipelines with GCP tools like Cloud Build and 
      Kubernetes. My focus these days is on leveraging DevOps practices and 
      cloud technologies to create infrastructure that’s as secure as it is 
      scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies,
      like building monitoring dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana or diving
      into infrastructure automation with Terraform. I’m always learning and
      looking for ways to contribute to innovative projects that push
      boundaries!
